This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a small project that is being developed to learn some Front-end with React. It's a simple idea for helping a small family business to help manage the financial control.

It's going to be paired with an API using Node.JS, initialy just using some basic fake API to test the React Components and some Responsive CSS styling.

Not using Flux or Redux just because the project is really small and don't require a more complex state management.

Also trying to apply some good practices of clean code following good old Uncle Bob.
