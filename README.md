This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a small project that is being developed to learn some Front end with React. It's a simple idea for helping a small family business to help manage the financial control.

It's going to be paired with an API using Node.JS, initialy just using some basic Mock API to test the React Components and some Responsive CSS styling.
